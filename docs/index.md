# Welcome VERSION 2.0

Welcome to the Helm documentation. Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes, and you can read detailed background information in the CNCF Helm Project Journey report.

## How the documentation is organized

Helm has a lot of documentation. A high-level overview of how it’s organized will help you know where to look for certain things:

* Tutorials take you by the hand through a series of steps to create your first Helm chart. Start here if you’re new to Helm.

* Topic guides discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.

* Community Guides discuss topics centered around Helm’s community. Start here if you want to learn more about the development process of Helm itself and how you can contribute.

* How-to guides are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how Helm works.
